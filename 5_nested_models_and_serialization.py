# Benefits of Nested Models
# --------------------------------

# Better organization of related data (e.g., vitals, address, insurance)

# Reusability: Use Vitals in multiple models (e.g., Patient, MedicalRecord)

# Readability: Easier for developers and API consumers to understand

# Validation: Nested models are validated automaticallyâ€”no extra work needed

# Serialization: Nested models can be serialized easily, making it easier to convert to JSON or other formats

# Performance: Nested models can be more efficient than flat models with many fields
